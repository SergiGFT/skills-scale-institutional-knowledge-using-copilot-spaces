# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

## Project Management Process: Summary
OctoAcme delivers cross-functional projects using clear roles, iterative planning, and robust risk management. Each phase — Initiation, Planning, Execution & Tracking, Release, Risk & Communication, Retrospectives, and Roles — is documented to enable consistent delivery, reduce onboarding time, and clarify expectations across teams. These documents provide templates, checklists, and decision gates that help teams move from idea to production reliably.

## How to use these docs
- Start with the Project Management Overview for a high-level understanding of roles, principles, and lifecycle.
- When launching a new project, complete the Project One-pager from the Project Initiation guide and follow the Initiation Checklist.
- Use the Planning doc to break work into shippable increments, identify dependencies, and create the release plan.
- Follow the Execution & Tracking doc for day-to-day workflows, CI/PR guidance, and escalation paths.
- Use the Risks & Communication doc to maintain the Risk Register and run stakeholder communications.
- Follow the Release & Deployment guide for pre-release checks, deployment steps, and rollback playbooks.
- After delivery, run the Retrospective & Continuous Improvement process to capture learnings and create action items.

## Contributing and Ownership
- Keep these docs up-to-date in the docs/ folder. When project-specific artifacts are created, add them to the project repo (project README, one-pager, risk register).
- For Copilot Spaces context, add process-specific docs into `.copilot/` in the project repository if you want them surfaced to the space.
