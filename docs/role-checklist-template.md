## Tips for Effective Role Definition

1. **Be specific but not prescriptive:** Provide enough clarity to guide work without micromanaging how it's done.
2. **Focus on outcomes:** Emphasize what the role achieves, not just activities performed.
3. **Avoid role silos:** Ensure roles complement each other and encourage collaboration.
4. **Review regularly:** Roles should evolve as the team and project mature.
5. **Get input:** Involve current role holders and stakeholders when defining or updating roles.
6. **Link to other docs:** Reference relevant process documents, templates, or guidelines that support the role.
